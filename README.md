# shadow casting
Implementation of the recursive shadow casting algorithm, defined [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=FOV_using_recursive_shadowcasting).

The explaination of the algorithm seems pretty verbose, but misses quite some details which make the difference between a correct output
and a completly wrong one. This implementation is heavily based on [this](https://fadden.com/tech/ShadowCast.cs.txt) example implementation from the article.

There is also [this](https://www.albertford.com/shadowcasting/) algorithm, which uses a different approach, but I was't able to implement it yet.
